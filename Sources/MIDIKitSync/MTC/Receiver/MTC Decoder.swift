/* Notes:
 
 Pro Tools
 ---------
 - Pro Tools (as of v2018.4) does not send any full frame messages.
 - Essentially, it does not send any location or relocation messages of any kind over MTC.
 - When normal playback begins (forwards in time, at 1:1 speed), PT starts transmitting quarter-frames. When playback stops, it simply stops transmitting quarter-frames. It does not complete a full frame before stopping MTC transmission, it will stop at the last quarter-frame
 - When half-speed playback starts (forwards in time, at half-speed), PT will transmit quarter-frames as normal, but they will transmit at half the speed. This is not necessary meant for the receiver to synchronize playback to, but to simply continue receiving timecode values to update its timecode display.
 - Pro Tools is capable of forwards and backwards scrubbing at various speeds, but does not transmit any MTC data while doing those operations.
 
 Cubase
 ------
 - Cubase Pro sends full frame messages.
 
 Logic Pro
 ---------
 - Logic Pro X (as of 10.4.1) does not send any full frame messages.

         Quarter-frame messages are received in this order during playback.
         Piece 0 is transmitted at the coded moment.
         When time is running forward, the piece numbers increment from 0–7; with the time that piece 0 is transmitted is the coded instant, and the remaining pieces are transmitted later.
         If rewinding, data is received in reverse order. Again, piece 0 is transmitted at the coded moment.
         Since 8 Quarter Frame messages are required to piece together the current SMPTE time, timing lock can't be achieved until the slave has received all 8 messages. This will take from 2 to 4 SMPTE Frames, depending upon when the slave comes online.
         The Frame number (contained in the first 2 Quarter Frame messages) is the SMPTE Frames Time for when the first Quarter Frame message is sent. But, because it takes 7 more quarter-frames to piece together the current SMPTE Time, when the slave does finally piece the time together, it is actually 2 SMPTE Frames behind the real current time. So, for display purposes, the slave should always add 2 frames to the current time.
