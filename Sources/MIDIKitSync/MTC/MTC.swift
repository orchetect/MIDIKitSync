//
// "MTC allows the synchronization of a sequencer or DAW with other devices that can synchronize to MTC"
//
// "MIDI time code (MTC) embeds the same timing information as standard SMPTE timecode as a series of small 'quarter-frame' MIDI messages. There is no provision for the user bits in the standard MIDI time code messages, and SysEx messages are used to carry this information instead. The quarter-frame messages are transmitted in a sequence of eight messages, thus a complete timecode value is specified every two frames. If the MIDI data stream is running close to capacity, the MTC data may arrive a little behind schedule which has the effect of introducing a small amount of jitter. In order to avoid this it is ideal to use a completely separate MIDI port for MTC data. Larger full-frame messages, which encapsulate a frame worth of timecode in a single message, are used to locate to a time while timecode is not running."
//
// "Unlike standard SMPTE timecode, MIDI timecode's quarter-frame and full-frame messages carry a two-bit flag value that identifies the rate of the timecode, specifying it as either:
//
// - 24 frame/s (standard rate for film work)
// - 25 frame/s (standard rate for PAL video)
// - 29.97 frame/s (drop-frame timecode for NTSC video)
// - 30 frame/s (non-drop timecode for NTSC video)"
//
// It is important to note that not all DAWs implement all features of MTC. For example, Pro Tools can generate or slave to MTC quarter frames, but does not transmit or receive full-frame messages - meaning Pro Tools will not locate to new timecodes when the MTC stream is not running. However, some other DAWs will.
